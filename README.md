# Todo App

A Flutter-based todo application that demonstrates modern mobile app development practices using Provider for state management, with authentication and CRUD operations for todo items.

## Overview

This is a complete Flutter todo application that includes user authentication (login/signup), todo management (create, read, update, delete), and a clean, Material Design 3 UI. The app uses Provider for state management and includes mock API calls to simulate real backend interactions.
